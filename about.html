        <p>
          This Status Posting System for a social networking site allows users
          to post their status and save it to a database table for later search
          and retrieval.
        </p>

          What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the
          site that we should know about?
        </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I added the custom CSS framework
            <a href="http://getskeleton.com" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> to
            create a responsive, user-friendly interface. Today, if a web
            application doesn't work for mobile, it "doesn't work".
          </li>
          <li>
            Buttons have been strategically colored to assist in guiding the
            user-flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tables were used when displaying search results to neatly align
            status messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            I made the assumption that the email address on the homepage had to
            be clickable, hence a user can easily create a new email.
          </li>
          <li>
            I made the assumption that the default sharing type is 'Only Me'.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h5>Which parts did you have trouble with?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When implementing the search result table, I noticed that status
            text would overflow the cell and cause issues when viewing on
            smaller device screens.
          </li>
          <li>
            While testing against my own hosted database, I was unable to
            validate if a table with the given name already exists. I then
            discovered my server hosted a MariaDB database (not MySQL) and hence
            had a different <code>information_schema</code> structure. Switching
            to XAMPP during development and testing resolved this issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            I had trouble casting the date into the correct format from input
            string to PHP <code>date()</code>, to MySQL-accepted YYYY-mm-dd
            format. After much testing, I learned via the
            <code>strtotime()</code> function documentation that: "Dates in the
            m/d/y or d-m-y formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator
            between the various components: if the separator is a slash (/),
            then the American m/d/y is assumed; whereas if the separator is a
            dash (-) or a dot (.), then the European d-m-y format is assumed.
            If, however, the year is given in a two digit format and the
            separator is a dash (-), the date string is parsed as y-m-d."

        <h5>What would you like to do better next time?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is room for improvement when it comes to the modularisation of
            similar page content, such as header and page title, which could be
            defined in their own functions, and dynamically inserted using
            <code>require_once()</code> rather than hard-coded in each file.
            This would allow for changes to be made in one location from where
            they are then propagated out.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would like to experiment with environment variables in external
            files rather than hard-coded values in multiple files. Coming from a
            JavaScript world, the principles of a
            <a href="https://12factor.net" target="_blank">12-Factor App</a>
            should be consistently applied across projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would like for the sections of this About page to collapse (by
            heading) into an accordion-like view which can be expanded and
            collapsed as desired for simpler navigation and mobile-friendliness.
          </li>

            Use Parameter Binding when creating the SQL queries.

          your website?

        <ul>
          <li>
            I referred to
            <a
              href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4997252/get-post-from-multiple-checkboxes"
              target="_blank"
            >this question</a>
            on Stack Overflow to learn how we extract multiple checkboxes from
            the posted form using
            <code>$_POST[]</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            To better understand the database connection component of this
            system, I frequently referred to the lecture slides.

          <li>
            Any PHP unknowns were resolved thanks to the PHP section of

        <h5>What you have learnt along the way?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A key learning for me was the MySQL table validation. Previously, I
            had not paid close attention to validating a table's existence but
            it is definitely something worth checking, going forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite not being new to the world of HTML, CSS, and PHP, I
            discovered inefficiencies in maintaining duplicate pieces of code -
            as outlined under:
            <i>What would you like to do better next time?</i> - which led me to
            ask questions around code modularity in PHP.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learnt that MySQL and MariaDB configure their
            <code>information_schema</code> differently, causing compatibility
            issues when checking for a given table's existence.
          </li>
          <li>
            I experimented with posting an array of permission checkboxes and
            creating another table in the database to match posts with
            permissions via a one-to-many relationship. However, I limited the
            scope of this project to a single (denormalised) table in the end.
          </li>
